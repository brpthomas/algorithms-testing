# Linked List 

A **linked list** is a linear collection of data elements, in which linear order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a group of nodes which together represent a sequence. 

In a simple form of a linked list, each node is composed of data and a reference to the next node in the sequence. This structuce allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the sequence during iteration. 

A drawback of linked lists is access time is linear. Faster access, such as random access, is not feasible. Arrays have better cache locality comparted to linked lists.
